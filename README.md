# Frescobaldi Sample Extension

This repository contains a sample extension for [Frescobaldi](http://frescobaldi.org),
the most complete IDE for the [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) scorewriter. It is a
simple “Hello World” extension without real functionality, demonstrating and explaining
the most important aspects of creating Frescobaldi extensions. The code in this sample
extension is heavily commented and - for demonstration purposes - more structured than
an extension of this small size would usually warrant.

As of this writing (Nov 2018) it is in a very unstable condition since it serves at the
same time as a demonstration and documentation as well as a tool for developing the
extensions infrastructure in Frescobaldi. Extensions are *not* officially supported in
Frescobaldi yet, in order to try out this sample extension one has to run Frescobaldi
from Git (see this
[Wiki page](https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi/wiki/Run-Frescobaldi-3-on-Linux),
specifically from the `dev/urs/extensions` branch. Eventually it will be merged to
the master branch and be released in version 3.1.

Along with the reference code in this sample extension the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/frescobaldi-extensions/sample-extension/wiki) of this repository
will serve as an introduction to writing extensions for Frescobaldi.
